        I am exploring a campaign to become president of the United States of America. I have a potentially globally and historically unprecedented testing profile. I have theorized and, as president, would develop a treatment for disease with genetic engineering, and I plan to negotiate with the possible medical advancements for world peace. I have other campaign goals. To read about them and more about me, please click the link at the top of the page for my autobiography.
